# 🚀 Agency Automation — AI-Powered Creative Task Management System

A full-stack automation platform that intelligently assigns creative tasks (Posters, Reels, Ads) to designers using smart workload balancing, skill-based routing, and deadline-priority algorithms — with real-time dashboards for Planners, Designers, and Admins.

---

## 💡 Problem vs Solution

| **❌ The Problem** | Creative agencies manually assign tasks via WhatsApp/Excel — leading to uneven designer workloads, missed deadlines, and near-impossible tracking. |
| **✅ The Solution** | A *Zero-Human Intervention* system that parses Google Drive CSVs and uses a math-based scoring engine to ensure fair work distribution and 100% automated tracking. |

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agency Automation eliminates manual task distribution in creative agencies. Planners upload a monthly CSV file to **Google Drive**, and the system **automatically parses, assigns, and tracks every task** through completion — with no human intervention needed for scheduling.

Built for a **6-designer, 2-planner, 1-admin** agency workflow.

## 👥 Role-Based Dashboards (RBAC)

Security and workflow integrity are maintained through 3 specialized dashboards:

| Role | Responsibility | Key Actions |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Decision Maker | Full visibility, Approve/Reject submissions, Reassign tasks, Manage leaves |
| **Planner** | Coordinator | Upload CSV, Monitor status (Read-only), Share approved assets with clients |
| **Designer** | Creative Execution | View today's tasks, Start/Submit work, Preview tomorrow's tasks |

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Auto-Assignment Engine
- Reads CSV from Google Drive (via OAuth 2.0) and auto-assigns tasks to designers
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm combining:
  - Skill match (Poster / Reel / Ads)
  - Live workload score
  - Deadline urgency weight
  - Date-wise availability check

### 📂 Google Drive Integration
- Planner uploads CSV → auto-detected via Google Drive API (OAuth 2.0)
- Filename encodes planner identity: `Karthik_2026-04-05-14-20_tasks.csv`
- Submissions uploaded to Drive's submissions folder
- File format validated before upload (CSV columns verified)

### 📅 Today-Only Task View
- All dashboards show **only today's tasks** (`publish_date` / `is_today` flag)
- Daily midnight cron auto-updates `is_today` flags in Supabase
- IST (Indian Standard Time) aware — all timestamps in +5:30 offset

### 📤 Designer Submission Flow

```
Assigned → Start Work → Submit File → Manager Review → Approved / Rejected → Resubmit
```

File format validation per task type:

| Task Type | Accepted Formats |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Poster** | PNG, JPG |
| **Reel** | MP4, MOV, AVI |
| **Ads** | PNG, JPG, GIF, MP4, ZIP |

### 🔔 Real-Time Notifications
- Designer starts work → Planner notified instantly
- Designer submits → Planner notified with file link
- Admin approves/rejects → Designer + Planner both notified

### 🏖️ Leave & No-Show Management
- Designer requests leave → Admin approves/rejects
- On approval → Tasks auto-reassigned to available designers
- No-login by 10 AM → Tasks auto-reassigned (cron checks at 10:00 AM & 10:30 AM)

### 📊 Client Requirements Tracking
- Each task stores client-specific content requirements
- Requirements visible to designers in task row and submit modal

### 🔑 Upload Token System
- Every CSV upload generates a unique token: `PLN-KARTHIK-20260405-142052-A3B7`
- Traceable in Admin's Upload Logs tab

## ⏰ Advanced Automated Workflows (Cron Jobs)

The system's core reliability runs on these scheduled jobs:

| Time (IST) | Automation Task | Logic / Condition |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **00:00 AM** | State Reset | Updates `is_today` flags in Supabase for current date filtering |
| **08:00 AM** | Urgency Alerts | Automatic 2-day deadline reminders sent to designers |
| **10:00 AM** | No-Show Detection | **Hybrid Logic:** Alerts Manager for manual reassignment. If no action by 10:30 AM, system auto-assigns to the next free designer |
| **04:00 PM** | EOD Pressure Alert | "Only 2 hours left!" reminder — prompts Admin approval if extra time is needed |
| **05:30 PM** | Tomorrow's Roadmap | Tomorrow's task list becomes visible as a "Preview" for advanced planning |
| **Every 30m** | Drive Polling | Scans Google Drive for new CSV uploads to trigger the Assignment Engine |

## 🧮 Algorithms Used

### 1. Smart Workload Score Algorithm
```
Score = active_tasks + (urgent_tasks × 0.5)
Lower score = less busy = assigned first
```
- `active_tasks` = Pending + Assigned + In Progress tasks
- `urgent_tasks` = tasks with deadline ≤ today (IST)

### 2. Date-Wise Availability Algorithm
```
New task arrives with Publish Date = April 7
  ↓
Check: Does designer have a task on April 7?
  → No  → Assign here (free on that date)
  → Yes → Compare total workload → assign to lower
```
Priority order:
1. Designer with **zero** tasks on that publish date
2. Tie-break by total active task count (lowest first)
3. Final tie-break by urgent task count

### 3. Skill-Based Routing
```
task_type = "Reel"
  ↓
Filter designers where skill IN ['reel']
  → Sneha (skill: reel)   ✅
  → Divya (skill: reel)   ✅
  → Lavanya (skill: poster) ❌  — filtered out
```

### 4. Urgent Task Priority Filter
```
Urgent task (deadline ≤ today):
  ↓
Prefer designers with 0 urgent tasks currently
  → If none free → pick designer with fewest urgent tasks
  → Score penalty: urgent_tasks × 0.5 added to workload score
```

### 5. Filename-Based Planner Identity
```
Filename: "Preethi_2026-04-05-14-20-52_tasks_batch2.csv"
  ↓
Split by "_" → parts[0] = "Preethi"
  ↓
planner_name = "Preethi" (stored on all tasks from this upload)
```

### 6. IST-Aware Date Filtering
```javascript
// UTC offset +5:30 applied manually for IST accuracy
function getISTDate() {
  const IST = new Date(new Date().getTime() + (5.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  return IST.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}
```

### 7. is_today Flag System
- Supabase `tasks.is_today` (boolean) updated by daily midnight cron
- All dashboards filter by `publish_date = today` (IST-aware)
- Prevents tomorrow's tasks from showing in today's view
